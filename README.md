I'm currently taking my BSc in Computer Engineering at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/).

I use git for pretty much all of the course, but in a lot of different platforms. Now, I decided to put all together.

All of the code here is student code, so don't get your hopes up.

If you're a Computer Engineering student looking at this, the projects will *probably* help you, especially because every now and then the professors hand over the same project assignments. If you need help through any part or if you need to find out what was the assignment we were supposed to do, your best bet is probably to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rgllm).
